# Neural-Network-project
In this project a Fully Connected Neural Network is used for a simple classification task. The main goal is not to solve a difficult task but to study the effects of different hyperameters on the NN. Both the Grid Search and the Random search Methods are used to optimize the choice of the hyperparameters. The results are presented in the form of an article.
